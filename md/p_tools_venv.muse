#title Folders and Virtual Environments

** Introduction

In this lesson, we will explore virtual environments in Python using
Visual Studio Code (VS Code). We’ll create a new workspace, set up a
virtual environment, and install packages specific to our project.

** Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

 - Create a new workspace in VS Code
 - Understand the concept of virtual environments
 - Create and use a virtual environment in VS Code
 - Install and use packages within a virtual environment

** Creating a New Workspace

On your desktop or in your =Documents= folder, create a new folder and
name it =graph_courses_python=. This is going to be the main folder for
many of the projects for this course so make sure you put it in an easy
to reach place.

Open VS Code.

Go to **File > Open Folder**.

Navigate to the =graph_courses_python= folder you just created and
select it.

Now create a new script and call it =test_cowsay.py=.

Type =print(2 + 2)= in the file then run it by clicking the run button
to make sure everything is working.

Next, let’s try to import a package we haven’t installed yet. Add the
following line to your file:

<example>
import cowsay

cowsay.cow("Hello, World!")
</example>

If you try to run this, you’ll get an error.

This will not work because we haven’t installed the =cowsay= package
yet. And to install it properly, we’ll need to use virtual environments.

*** Vocab: Environments & Interpreter

 - An **environment** is a folder that contains a specific version of
   Python and any packages you install.
 - The **Python Interpreter** is the specific

** Creating a Virtual Environment

 1. Open the **Command Palette**
 2. Type =Python: Create Environment= and select it.
 3. Choose **Venv** as the environment type.
 4. Select the Python interpreter you want to use (e.g., Python 3.12.0).

You should now see a new folder called =.venv=. This is the virtual
environment. Inside it is a folder called =lib=, which contains
packages.

Next, tell VS Code to use this virtual environment:

 1. Open the **Command Palette** again.
 2. Type =Python: Select Interpreter= and choose it.
 3. Select the interpreter associated with your virtual environment (it
    should be listed under =.venv=).

Now we’ve created and selected our virtual environment. We can install
packages without affecting other projects.

** Installing Packages

Let’s install the =cowsay= package.

 1. Open a **new terminal** in VS Code. You can do this with the
    terminal file menu option then selecting ‘new terminal’.
 2. Ensure the terminal is using your virtual environment. You can do
    this by hovering over the terminal icon in terminal window. It
    should mention that there is an activated environment for ….venv
    among other things
 3. Run the following command:

<example>
#| eval: false
pip install cowsay
</example>

Occasionally, you might encounter an issue where pip is not recognized
in the terminal. This is likely due to a temporary glitch in VS Code’s
environment detection. If this happens, try the following steps:

 1. Close and reopen VS Code.
 2. Use the Command Palette to select the Python interpreter again.
 3. Open a new terminal.

These steps should resolve the issue and restore access to pip. If the
problem persists, it may indicate a more complex configuration problem
that requires further investigation.

Now we should be able to use the =cowsay= package. Open =test_cowsay.py=
and click the run button to execute the script.

You should see a cow saying hello!

** Summary of Key Steps

Congrats! You have now created a virtual environment and installed a
package.

These are key steps for any new Python project:

 1. <strong>F</strong>older: Create a project folder.
 2. <strong>E</strong>nvironment: Set up a virtual environment.
 3. <strong>I</strong>nterpreter: Select the appropriate Python
    interpreter.
 4. <strong>L</strong>ibraries: Install the necessary packages.

Remember the acronym **FEIL** to help you recall these steps. (If you
don’t complete these steps you increase your chances of “FEIL”ure 😅)

It’s a bit of a pain to have to set up a virtual environment every time
you start a new project, but it’s a good habit to get into.

** Demonstrating Environment Isolation

Let’s demonstrate that the virtual environment is isolated.

 1. Open your previous workspace =my_first_workspace= with the File >
    Open Folder menu option.
 2. Create a Python file and try to use the =cowsay= package:

    <verbatim>:::</verbatim> {.cell
    <verbatim>execution_count=2}</verbatim>
    ={.python .cell-code}  import cowsay= <verbatim>:::</verbatim>

This will probably not work because =cowsay= is not installed in that
environment. If it does work, it means you have =cowsay= installed
globally, which is okay.

Now, let’s return to our main folder/workspace. This is where you’ll
conduct most of your analysis for this course.

** Installing Course Packages

As a final step, let’s install the packages we’ll need for the course.
While we could install each package as we encounter it, it’s more
efficient to install them all at once. In the terminal, run the
following command. Type these very carefully.

<example>
#| eval: false
pip install plotly pandas jupyter ipykernel kaleido itables
</example>

 - **pandas**: Data manipulation library.
 - **plotly**: Visualization library.
 - **jupyter** and **ipykernel**: Allow us to use Quarto to display our
   plots.
 - **kaleido**: Library for saving plots in different formats.
 - **itables**: Library for displaying tables in Quarto.

When its done installing, your cursor in the terminal should be active
again. e.g. you should be able to press enter to start a new command.

Keep this list of packages handy for future reference, as you’ll likely
need them for most projects.

This command will install all the required packages in one go. If your
installation stops at some point, try rerunning the command. Sometimes
network issues may cause the installation to fail. If it freezes for
more than 10 minutes, close the terminal and rerun the command.

** Conclusion

You’ve now learned how to create a workspace, set up a virtual
environment, install packages, and use them in your Python projects.
Remember that each project should have its own virtual environment to
keep dependencies isolated and manageable.
