BELOW ARE GIVEN AN EXAMPLE QUIZ FORMAT AND ALSO A LESSON THAT I WANT YOU TO GENERATE A SIMILAR QUIZ ON. 

THE QUIZ SHOULD HAVE 7 TO 20 QUESTIONS, DEPENDING ON IF THERE IS ENOUGH STUFF TO ASK.

THE TITLE SHOULD BE "Multiple Choice Quiz | Topic Name"

AVOID PUNCTUATION OTHER THAN # Q: IN THE TITLES (EG NO HYPHENS OR QUESTION MARKS)

FAVOR QUESTIONS WITH ~3 ANSWER OPTIONS. BE SURE TO VARY THE CORRECT OPTION BETWEEN A B AND C.

FAVOR QUESTIONS THAT INCLUDE CODE EXAMPLES IN THE QUESTION OR IN THE OPTIONS. CODE CHUNKS SHOULD BE ENSCONCED IN ```python  ```

HERE IS THE EXAMPLE QUIZ:

title: "Multiple Choice Quiz | Example Topic"

# Intro 

Welcome to an example quiz. As you can see, each quiz should have a a title, intro then series of questions. 

For each question, you first have a title header that is indicated by "# Q: ", plus a short title (with no extra punctuation), and then the question. 

Note that the student does not see the title header, so the actual question should be in the question, not the title header.

The answer options must start with "## A", "## B" and so on. 

After the answer options, you have the correct answer, indicated by "## Answer". 

If there are multiple correct answers, you can separate them by a pipe symbol "|". 

After the correct answer, you have a single correct message, indicated by "## Correct message". 

After the correct message, you have a single incorrect message, indicated by "## Incorrect message". 

# Q: Definition of Power

What is the definition of 'power'?

## A

The probability that the null hypothesis is true.

## B

The probability that the null hypothesis is false.

## C

The probability that a false null hypothesis will be rejected.

## D

The probability that a true null hypothesis will be rejected.

## Answer

C

## Correct message

Well done! Power is the probability that you will reject the null hypothesis correctly, meaning you find evidence of an association when one truly exists.

## Incorrect message

Power is the probability that you will reject the null hypothesis correctly, meaning you find evidence of an association when one truly exists.

# Q: Sample Size Estimation Parameters

What information/parameters do you need before you can estimate the **sample size** needed for a particular study? Choose all that apply.

## A

Alpha level (i.e. level of significance you will accept as proof against the null) hypothesis.

## B

Beta level (i.e. amount of power you want).

## C

Standard deviation of the population (if estimating difference in means).

## D

Expected true difference in means/proportion of the outcome variable.

## E

An expected sample size.

## Answer

A|B|C|D

## Correct message

Nice work! The essential parameters for estimating sample size include alpha level, beta level, standard deviation of the population, and the expected true difference in means or proportion of the outcome variable.

## Incorrect message

The essential parameters for estimating sample size include alpha level, beta level, standard deviation of the population, and the expected true difference in means or proportion of the outcome variable.


# Q: Sample Size for Cholesterol Study

Estimate the total sample size needed to compare the mean total cholesterol between two groups of men, with versus without coronary heart disease (CHD). Assume 90% power, and a 5% significance level.

## A

Approximately 86 participants are needed in total.

## B

Approximately 172 participants are needed in total.

## C

None of the above.

## Answer

B

## Correct message

Indeed! Approximately 172 participants in total are needed, with 86 participants per group.

## Incorrect message

You need 86 participants per group, making a total of 172 participants.
