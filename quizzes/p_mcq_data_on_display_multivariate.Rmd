# Intro 

Welcome to this quiz on creating bivariate and multivariate graphs with Plotly Express. Answer each question by selecting the best choice(s). Good luck!

# Q: Basic Scatter Plot

Which code snippet correctly creates a basic scatter plot of 'total_bill' vs. 'tip' using the 'tips' dataset?

## A
```python
px.bar(tips, x="total_bill", y="tip")
```

## B
```python
px.scatter(tips, x="total_bill", y="tip")
```

## C
```python
px.scatterplot(tips, x="total_bill", y="tip")
```

## Answer

B

## Correct message

Correct! px.scatter is used to create scatter plots for numeric vs. numeric data.

## Incorrect message

Remember that px.scatter is the function for scatter plots in Plotly Express.


# Q: Overlay Histograms

You want to overlay histograms by sex in the 'tips' dataset so that both categories are transparent and placed on top of each other. Which parameter setting accomplishes this?

## A
barmode='group'

## B
barmode='overlay'

## C
barnorm='percent'

## Answer

B

## Correct message

Exactly! barmode='overlay' creates overlaid histograms.

## Incorrect message

barmode='overlay' is what positions both histograms on top of each other with transparency.


# Q: Bar Charts vs Histogram

Given the following code, which statement is true about why two different functions are used?

```python
px.histogram(tips, x="sex")

px.bar(sex_counts, x="sex", y="count")
```

## A
px.bar automatically groups categorical data, whereas px.histogram requires pre-aggregated data.

## B
px.histogram automatically groups and counts the data, while px.bar typically expects you to provide the grouped or aggregated values.

## C
Both functions do exactly the same thing with no difference in usage.

## Answer

B

## Correct message

Yes! px.histogram does the grouping for you, while px.bar needs aggregated data as input.

## Incorrect message

Remember that px.histogram counts occurrences within each category, whereas px.bar usually visualizes pre-aggregated data.


# Q: Stacked Bar Charts Parameter

Which parameter transforms a stacked bar chart into a percent-stacked bar chart in Plotly Express?

## A
barnorm='percent'

## B
barmode='overlay'

## Answer

A

## Correct message

Correct! Setting barnorm='percent' creates a percent-stacked bar chart.

## Incorrect message

Use barnorm='percent' to show proportions instead of raw counts in the stacked bars.


# Q: Time Series Visualization

Which function in Plotly Express is most suitable for visualizing continuous data over time?

## A
```python
px.line(df, x="year", y="pop")
```

## B
```python
px.scatter(df, x="year", y="pop")
```

## C
```python
px.histogram(df, x="year")
```

## Answer

A

## Correct message

Correct! px.line is ideal for displaying trends over continuous time.

## Incorrect message

px.line is specifically designed for continuous variables like time.

# Q: Facet Scatter

You want to facet the scatter plot of the 2007 Gapminder data by continent, producing multiple subplots in columns. Which parameter is used to split the data by columns?

```python
px.scatter(
    g_2007,
    x="gdpPercap",
    y="lifeExp",
    color="continent",
    __________="continent"
)
```

## A
group_col

## B
facet_col

## C
row="continent"

## Answer

B

## Correct message

You've got it! facet_col splits the data into multiple columns by the specified variable.

## Incorrect message

To facet by columns, remember to specify facet_col with the desired variable.
