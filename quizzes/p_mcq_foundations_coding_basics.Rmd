# Intro

Welcome to the Coding Basics Quiz! Test your knowledge on Python comments, basic arithmetic operations, variable usage, and more. Good luck!

# Q: Multiline Comments

Which code chunk(s) below will NOT produce an error when used as multi-line comments in Python?

## A

```
"""
This is a multi-line
comment in Python
"""
2 + 2
```

## B

```
'''
This is another multi-line
comment in Python
'''
2 + 2
```

## C

```
'''
This won't work
2 + 2
```

## Answer
A|B

## Correct message
Correct! Triple quotes (either """ or ''') can be used for multi-line comments/docstrings. Note that option C is missing its closing quotes.

## Incorrect message

Triple quotes (either """ or ''') can be used for multi-line comments/docstrings. Note that option C is missing its closing quotes.

# Q: Square Root of 100
Consider the following code snippets. Which snippet correctly uses the math module to calculate the square root of 100?

## A
```
import math
sqrt(100)
```

## B
```
import math
math.sqrt(100)
```

## C
```
import math
math.SQrt(100)
```

## Answer
B

## Correct message
Well done! math.sqrt(100) is the correct usage for finding the square root.

## Incorrect message
Remember to call the function as math.sqrt(...), exactly matching lowercase function names.

# Q: Using Input to Store a Name
Which code snippet correctly prompts the user to input their name and then prints it?

## A
```
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", name)
```

## B
```
getinput("What is your name?")
print("Hello,", name)
```

## C
input("What is your name? ")
print("Your name is," name)

## Answer
A

## Correct message
Exactly! input("Enter your name: ") captures user input, and print displays it.

## Incorrect message
Check that you're using the built-in input() function in Python and that your syntax for print statements is correct.

# Q: Valid Variable Names
Which of the following are valid variable names in Python? Choose all that apply.

## A
my_age = 30

## B
2cool4school = "Python"

## C
myFullName = "Alice Doe"

## D
_secret_code = 42

## Answer
A|C|D

## Correct message
Good job! Variables cannot start with a number, but can use letters, underscores, or a combination.

## Incorrect message
Remember: variable names can't start with a digit. Also avoid special characters other than underscores.

# Q: Result of Subtraction
Look at the following code:

```
eight = 9
answer = eight - 8
print(answer)
```

What value is printed?

## A
1

## B
8

## C
-1

## Answer
A

## Correct message
Precisely! nine minus eight is one. The variable eight is set to 9, so 9 - 8 = 1.

## Incorrect message
Check the arithmetic: 9 - 8 is 1. The variable eight is set to 9, so 9 - 8 = 1.

# Q: Indentation Error
Which snippet correctly fixes this indentation error?

Original code (which fails):
```python
import math
 math.sqrt(100)
```

## A
```python
import math
math.sqrt(100)
```

## B
```python
import math
    math.sqrt(100)
```

## Answer
A

## Correct message
Exactly! Removing the extra space before math.sqrt fixes the indentation error.

## Incorrect message
Remember that Python uses indentation to mark code blocks, so leading spaces in unexpected places cause errors.
