# Intro 

In this quiz, you will test your knowledge of Python lists, dictionaries, Pandas Series, and DataFrames. Please read each question carefully and choose the best answer(s). Good luck!

# Q: Python Lists Intro

Which code snippet creates a Python list named shopping that contains the strings "apples" and "milk" in that order?

## A
```python
shopping = ["milk", "apples"]
```

## B
```python
shopping = ["apples", "milk"]
```

## C
```python
shopping = ("apples", "milk")
```

## Answer
B

## Correct message
Great job! A Python list with "apples" and "milk" would be created using square brackets in the order ["apples", "milk"].

## Incorrect message
Remember that Python lists are created with square brackets in the correct order.

# Q: Zero Based Indexing

Consider the list below:

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40]
```

Which expression prints the element 30?

## A
```python
print(nums[2])
```

## B
```python
print(nums[1])
```

## C
```python
print(nums[3])
```

## Answer
A

## Correct message
Correct! The third element is at index 2 because Python uses zero-based indexing.

## Incorrect message
Integer indexing in Python starts at 0, so nums[2] is the third element.

# Q: Dictionary Usage

Which line of code correctly creates a dictionary called contacts with "Alice" mapped to "555-1234" and "Bob" mapped to "555-5678"?

## A
```python
contacts = ["Alice": "555-1234", "Bob": "555-5678"]
```

## B
```python
contacts = {"Alice": "555-1234", "Bob": "555-5678"}
```

## C
```python
contacts = {"Alice" -> "555-1234", "Bob" -> "555-5678"}
```

## Answer
B

## Correct message
Good work! Dictionaries are created with curly braces and key-value pairs separated by a colon.

## Incorrect message
Remember that Python dictionaries are defined with curly braces and colons for key-value pairs.

# Q: Modifying a Dictionary

Suppose you have this dictionary:

```python
grades = {"Alice": 90, "Bob": 85}
```

Which of the following will update Bob's grade to 95?

## A
```python
grades("Bob") = 95
```

## B
```python
grades["Bob"] = 95
```

## C
```python
grades.update("Bob"=95)
```

## Answer
B

## Correct message
Great! We use the key in square brackets to update a value in a Python dictionary.

## Incorrect message
Recall that to set a value in a dictionary, we use dictionary_name[key] = value.

# Q: Creating a Pandas Series

Which code snippet creates a Pandas Series with the values 2, 4, 6 and assigns it to a variable called my_series?

## A
```python
my_series = np.PandasSeries([2, 4, 6])
```

## B
```python
my_series = pd.Series([2, 4, 6])
```

## C
```python
my_series = pd.Series{
    'first': 2, 
    'second': 4, 
    'third': 6
}
```

## Answer
B

## Correct message
Exactly! A Pandas Series is created with pd.Series([...]) syntax.

## Incorrect message
Remember that pd.Series(...) creates a one-dimensional labeled array.

# Q: Descriptive Statistics with Series

After you create a Pandas Series like this:

```python
temps = pd.Series([10, 20, 30])
```

Which of the following lines of code will correctly return the mean of temps?

## A
```python
temps.describe()["mean"]
```

## B
```python
temps.mean()
```

## C
```python
temps.stats["mean"]
```

## Answer
B

## Correct message
Correct! The .mean() method returns the average value of the Series.

## Incorrect message
Recall that .mean() is the direct method to compute the average of a Series.

# Q: DataFrame Creation

Which option below shows valid ways to create a DataFrame named people_df with columns called "name" and "age"?

## A
```python
people_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "name": ["Alice", "Bob"],
        "age": [25, 30]
    }
)
```

## B
```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob"]
ages = [25, 30]
people_df = pd.DataFrame({"name": names, "age": ages})
```

## C
```python
people_df = pd.DataFrame([ ["Alice", "Bob"], [25, 30] ])
```

## Answer
A|B

## Correct message
Correct! A DataFrame can be created using a dictionary with column names as keys.

## Incorrect message
A DataFrame can be created using a dictionary with column names as keys.

# Q: Selecting Multiple Columns

Given the DataFrame people_df:

```python
people_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
        "age": [25, 30, 28],
        "city": ["Lagos", "London", "Lima"],
    }
)
```

Which code snippet selects only the name and city columns?

## A
```python
people_df[["name", "city"]]
```

## B
```python
people_df["name", "city"]
```

## Answer
A

## Correct message
Well done!

## Incorrect message
To select multiple columns, you can pass a list of column names in double brackets.
