# Intro

Welcome to this quiz on Python for loops. Answer the questions below to test your understanding of the material. Good luck!

# Q: Basic For Loop Structure

What is the correct basic structure for a for loop in Python that prints each value in a list called my_list?

## A

```python
for x in my_list:
    print(x)
```

## B

```python
for x in my_list
    print(x)
```

## C

```python
for x in range(my_list):
    print(x)
```

## Answer

A

## Correct message

Perfect. The correct syntax is for x in my_list: followed by an indented block of code.

## Incorrect message

Remember, a colon and correct indentation are required for a valid for loop in Python.

# Q: Repeating Versus Multiplying

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
ages = [7, 8, 9]
print(ages * 3)
```

Which of the following will it output?

## A

[21, 24, 27]

## B

[7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 9]

## Answer

B

## Correct message

Exactly right. Multiplying a list by 12 repeats the list 12 times. To multiply each element by 12, you need to loop through the list. Or use a Series object instead of a list.

## Incorrect message

Multiplying a list by 12 repeats the list 12 times. To multiply each element by 12, you need to loop through the list. Or use a Series object instead of a list.

# Q: Using For Loops Versus Vectorized Operations

What is one reason why a for loop might still be useful in Python, even though libraries like pandas can perform vectorized operations?

## A

For loops are always faster than any vectorized approach.

## B

For loops allow fine-grained control and can handle non-vectorizable tasks.

## C

For loops are mandatory for all arithmetic in Python.

## Answer

B

## Correct message

Correct. For loops provide flexibility for tasks that cannot be easily vectorized.

## Incorrect message

For loops do not necessarily run faster than pandas, but they allow more control in certain scenarios.

# Q: Printing with F Strings

What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
age = 7
print(f"{age} years is {age * 12} months")
```

## A

It prints "7 years is 84 months".

## B

It prints "{age} years is {age * 12} months".

## C

It throws an error because braces cannot be used in strings.

## Answer

A

## Correct message

Nice work. F-strings allow direct variable embedding.

## Incorrect message

F-strings use curly braces for variable interpolation, resulting in "7 years is 84 months".

# Q: Writing a Loop with Enumerate

Which of the following code snippets correctly prints both the index and the age using enumerate?

## A

```python
for i, age in ages:
    print(f"Index {i}: {age}")
```

## B

```python
for i, age in enumerate(ages):
    print(f"Index {i}: {age}")
```

## C

```python
for i in ages:
    print(i, enumerate(ages))
```

## Answer

B

## Correct message

Yes. We need for i, age in enumerate(ages) to unpack the index and value.

## Incorrect message

We must use enumerate(ages) in the loop to access both index and value.

# Q: Basic Loop to Print Hours to Minutes

What is the correct way to convert a list of hours to minutes using a for loop and print the result using f-strings? Suppose hours = [3, 4, 5].

## A

```python
for hour in hours:
    print(f"{hour} hours is {hour * 60} minutes")
```

## B

```python
for hour in hours:
    print(f"{hour} hours is 60")
```

## C

```python
for hours in range(hours):
    print(hours * 60)
```

## Answer

A

## Correct message

Good job. Multiplying each hour by 60 and printing is correct.

## Incorrect message

We need to loop through each hour in hours, then multiply hour by 60.

# Q: Loop Indentation

What is the significance of indentation in a Python for loop?

## A

Indentation is optional as long as braces {} are used.

## B

Indentation is only needed if there are multiple statements in the loop.

## C

Indentation is required to define the block of code to execute within the loop.

## Answer

C

## Correct message

That is correct. Python relies on indentation to mark code blocks.

## Incorrect message

Unlike some other languages, Python does not use braces but instead uses indentation to define blocks.
