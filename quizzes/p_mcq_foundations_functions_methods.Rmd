---

# Intro 

Welcome to this quiz on functions, methods, and libraries in Python. Answer each question below by choosing the best option(s).

# Q: Purpose of Functions

Which statement best describes a function in Python?

## A

A block of code that performs a specific task and can be called multiple times.

## B

A special type of variable that holds a numeric value only.

## C

A built-in integer method provided by the Python language.

## Answer

A

## Correct message

Correct! Functions are blocks of code that can accept arguments (parameters), perform actions, and return results.

## Incorrect message

A function is a block of code that can perform a certain task and can be reused by calling it multiple times.

# Q: Using Round

Which of the following code snippets correctly rounds 3.1415 to 2 decimal places via keyword arguments?

## A

``` 
round(2, number=3.1415)
```

## B

```
round(number=3.1415, ndigits=2)
```

## C

```
round(3.1415, 2, keyword=True)
```

## Answer

B

## Correct message

Great job! Specifying the argument names (e.g., number=3.1415, ndigits=2) is the correct way to use keyword arguments.

## Incorrect message

Using keyword arguments for round() looks like: round(number=3.1415, ndigits=2).

# Q: Calling Methods

Which of these code snippets calls a string method to replace "p" with "üêç" in "python"?

## A

```
"python".replace("p", "üêç")
```

## B

```
replace("python", "p", "üêç")
```

## C

```
("python").method("p", "üêç")
```

## Answer

A

## Correct message

Yes! "python".replace("p", "üêç") applies the replace() method to the string object.

## Incorrect message

"python".replace("p", "üêç") is the correct syntax for calling the replace() method on a string.

# Q: Importing Math

What is the correct way to import and use the sqrt() function from the math module?

## A

```
import math
math.sqrt(16)
```

## B

```
from math import sqrt
sqrt(16)
```

## C

Both of the above

## Answer

C

## Correct message

Exactly! You can import math and call math.sqrt, or import just sqrt and call sqrt directly.

## Incorrect message

You can either import the entire math module or import specific functions like sqrt.

# Q: Installing a Library

In a Google Colab environment, which command installs the cowsay library so that you can import it afterwards?

## A

```
!pip install cowsay
```

## B

```
import cowsay
```

## C

```
pip install cowsay
```

## Answer

A

## Correct message

Right! In Colab, the exclamation mark (!) is used before pip install commands.

## Incorrect message

In Colab, you need !pip install cowsay to install the library before importing it.
