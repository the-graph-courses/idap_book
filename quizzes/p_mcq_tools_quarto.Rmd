title: "Multiple Choice Quiz | Using Quarto"
---

# Intro 

Welcome to this quiz on Quarto. Answer the following questions to test your knowledge of creating and rendering Quarto documents, managing code chunks, and generating different output formats.

# Q: Purpose of Quarto

What is the main purpose of Quarto?

## A

It is primarily used for data storage

## B

It enables the creation of dynamic documents that combine formatted text and code results

## C

It is exclusively used for building mobile applications

## Answer

B

## Correct message

Well done! Quarto allows you to combine narrative text and code results in one document for dynamic, reproducible reporting.

## Incorrect message

Quarto excels at creating dynamic documents that combine text and code results, rather than solely storing data or building mobile applications.

# Q: Document Header for HTML

Which YAML header best defines an HTML output format in Quarto?

## A
```yaml
---
format: python
---
```

## B
```yaml
---
output: html_document
---
```

## C
```yaml
---
title: "My First Quarto Document"
format: html
---
```

## Answer

C

## Correct message

Correct! Specifying "format: html" in the YAML header tells Quarto to render an HTML document.

## Incorrect message

To render an HTML document, you should set "format: html" in the YAML header.

# Q: Hiding code chunk

Which code chunk option hides the code while displaying the output in an HTML document?

## A
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#| echo: true
print("Hello")
```

## B
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#| echo: false
print("Hello")
```

## C
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#| output: hide
print("Hello")
```

## Answer

B

## Correct message

Nice job! "#| echo: false" hides the code but still shows the output in the rendered document.

## Incorrect message

Use "#| echo: false" to hide the code while displaying its output.

# Q: Global code options in YAML

Which YAML snippet correctly sets a global option to hide code echoes for all code chunks?

## A
```yaml
---
execute:
  show-code: false
---
```

## B
```yaml
---
defaults:
  echo: false
---
```

## C
```yaml
---
execute:
  echo: false
---
```

## Answer

C

## Correct message

Exactly! Placing "execute: echo: false" in the YAML section will hide code in all chunks by default.

## Incorrect message

You should set "execute: echo: false" under the execute key in the YAML to hide code in all chunks.

# Q: Interactive tables

Which Python library was covered as a way to display interactive tables in a Quarto HTML document?

## A

itables

## B

matplotlib

## C

dash

## Answer

A

## Correct message

Good job! "itables" lets you create interactive tables in an HTML output.

## Incorrect message

The "itables" package is used to create interactive data tables in Quarto HTML documents.
