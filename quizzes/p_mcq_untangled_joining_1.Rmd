# Intro

Welcome to our quiz on joining datasets in pandas. Below are a series of questions based on the lesson you have studied. Good luck!

# Q: Basic Merge

Which function in pandas is typically used to join two dataframes on a matching column?

## A

pd.concat()

## B

pd.merge()

## C

pd.combine()

## Answer

B

## Correct message

Correct! pd.merge() is the primary pandas function used for joining two dataframes on a specified key.

## Incorrect message

Remember, pd.merge() is the core function for joining two dataframes on a matching column.

# Q: Default Join Type

By default, which type of join does pd.merge() perform if the argument how is not specified?

## A

left

## B

inner

## C

outer

## Answer

B

## Correct message

Yes! pd.merge() uses an inner join by default. This type of join keeps only the rows where the key values match in both dataframes.

## Incorrect message

pd.merge() defaults to an inner join when how is not specified. This type of join keeps only the rows where the key values match in both dataframes.

# Q: Join with Key Columns

You have two dataframes: one has a column named "name" while the other arranges the same column under "first_name", as shown in the below markdown table:

**df1:**
| name | age |
|------|-----|
| John | 25  |
| Mary | 30  |
| Bob  | 35  |

**df2:**
| first_name | city    |
|------------|---------|
| John       | Chicago |
| Mary       | Boston  |
| Alice      | Denver  |

You want to match rows from both. Which pd.merge call is correct?

## A

```python
pd.merge(df1, df2, on=c("name", "first_name"))
```

## B

```python
pd.merge(df1, df2, left_on="name", right_on="first_name")
```

## C

```python
pd.merge(df1, df2, how="outer")
```

## Answer

B

## Correct message

Good job! When the key columns have different names, use left_on and right_on to specify the matching columns.

## Incorrect message

Remember to use left_on and right_on when your key columns are named differently.

# Q: Left Join Explanation

When performing a left join in pandas, which statement best describes how rows are kept?

## A

All rows from the right dataframe are preserved, even if they do not match.

## B

All rows from the left dataframe are preserved, even if they do not match.

## C

Only rows that match in both dataframes are preserved.

## Answer

B

## Correct message

Exactly! A left join keeps every row from the left dataframe, matching rows from the right where possible.

## Incorrect message

A left join retains all rows from the left dataframe, whether or not they have matches in the right dataframe.

# Q: Code Example Left Join

Consider the following code:

```python
city_employment
state_lookup

pd.merge(city_employment, state_lookup, on="city", how="left")
```

What is a valid reason to use city_employment as the left dataframe in this left merge scenario?

## A

We want to keep all cities from the employment dataset, even if their state information is missing.

## B

We want to exclude any cities not found in state_lookup.

## C

We want to include only cities where data are present in both dataframes.

## Answer

A

## Correct message

Correct! Using city_employment as the left dataframe ensures we keep employment data for all cities, even if we can't find their corresponding state.

## Incorrect message

We want to keep all rows from the employment dataset, so any cities without matching state data will still appear in our results.

# Q: Outer Join Preservation

With an outer join, which best describes the rows that appear in the final merged dataframe?

## A

Only rows matching in both dataframes

## B

Rows from the left dataframe only

## C

All rows from both dataframes, with missing matches filled by NaN

## Answer

C

## Correct message

Correct! An outer join includes all rows from both dataframes, filling where matches are missing.

## Incorrect message

An outer join retains all rows from both dataframes, even if there's no match.
