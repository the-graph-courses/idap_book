# Intro 

Welcome to this quiz on one-to-many merges, multi-key joins, and handling key mismatches in Python. Answer the multiple choice questions below to test your understanding of these concepts.


# Q: Multiple Keys

Consider these two dataframes showing grade and attendance information for students. A single student can take multiple courses in different semesters:

**df1:**

| student_id | semester | grade |
|------------|----------|-------|
| 101        | Fall     | A     |
| 101        | Spring   | B     |
| 102        | Fall     | B+    |
| 102        | Spring   | A-    |

**df2:**

| student_id | semester | attendance |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 101        | Fall     | 95%       |
| 101        | Spring   | 88%       |
| 102        | Fall     | 92%       |
| 103        | Spring   | 85%       |

Which code snippet correctly merges these dataframes to match grades with attendance for each student-semester combination?

## A

```python
pd.merge(df1, df2, on=["student_id", "semester"])
```

## B

```python
pd.merge(df1, df2, on=["student_id"])
```

## C

```python
pd.merge(df1, df2, left_on="student_id", right_on="student_id")
```

## Answer

A

## Correct message

Well done! Using both student_id and semester as keys ensures we match the correct attendance with each student's grade for that specific semester. Using only student_id would incorrectly match across semesters.

## Incorrect message

We need both student_id and semester as keys because a student can have different grades and attendance in different semesters. Using just student_id would create incorrect matches.

# Q: Using Country Codes

What is the primary reason for converting country names to ISO3 codes before merging?

## A

It makes the code run faster

## B

It standardizes country identifiers across data sources even if the country names differ

## C

It reduces the memory usage of the dataframes, since ISO3 codes are shorter than country names

## Answer

B

## Correct message

Correct. Using ISO3 codes helps match countries even when their names vary.

## Incorrect message

Using country codes ensures consistency by providing standardized identifiers for countries.

# Q: Data Duplication in One-to-Many

Below are two DataFrames that we want to merge on the `store_id` column:

**Stores** (3 rows):

| store_id | store_name    |
|----------|---------------|
| 1        | MainBranch    |
| 2        | HilltopBranch |
| 3        | Riverside     |

**Transactions** (6 rows):

| store_id | transaction_id | amount |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| 1        | T1001          | 150    |
| 1        | T1002          | 220    |
| 2        | T2003          | 75     |
| 3        | T3001          | 300    |
| 3        | T3002          | 125    |
| 3        | T3003          | 90     |

Consider the following code:

```python
merged_df = pd.merge(Stores, Transactions, on="store_id", how="left")
```

What happens to the data in **Stores** during this merge?

## A
Rows in Stores remain unique and never duplicate

## B
Each row in Stores is repeated once for every matching row in Transactions

## C
All missing store rows are dropped

## Answer
B

## Correct message
Exactly. A one-to-many merge causes the "one" side rows to duplicate for each matching row in the "many" side.

## Incorrect message
In a one-to-many merge, the store rows are duplicated for each matching transaction row.

# Q: Key Formatting Mismatch

Below is a **Countries** DataFrame and a **Population** DataFrame. 

**Countries**:

| country_name       | iso_code |
|--------------------|----------|
| United States      | USA      |
| Canada             | CAN      |
| Mexico             | MEX      |

**Population**:

| country_name      | population |
|-------------------|------------|
| united states     | 331000000  |
| Canada            | 37000000   |
| Mexico            | 127000000  |

If we do an inner merge on `country_name`, what will the output be?

## A

| country_name | iso_code | population |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Canada       | CAN      | 37000000   |
| Mexico       | MEX      | 127000000  |

## B

| country_name | iso_code | population |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Canada       | CAN      | 37000000   |

## C

| country_name | iso_code | population |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| United States | USA     | 331000000  |
| Canada       | CAN      | 37000000   |
| Mexico       | MEX      | 127000000  |

## Answer
C

## Correct message
Correct. The mismatch in "United States" vs "united states" causes them not to match.

## Incorrect message
It's a case/spelling mismatch. "United States" and "united states" will not join unless we fix the formatting. The other two countries will match.


# Q: Practical Example of Data Cleaning Before Merge

We want to fix mismatched country names by capitalizing the first letter of each word and removing any trailing spaces before merging. Which code snippet is correct?

## A
```python
df["country_name"] = df["country_name"].str.title().str.strip()
```

## B
```python
df["country_name"] = country_name.title().strip()
```

## C
```python
df["country_name"] = df["country_name"].title().strip()
```

## Answer
A

## Correct message
Good job! Using `str.title()` and `str.strip()` ensures each entry is cleaned properly.

## Incorrect message
Remember to apply `.str.title()` and `.str.strip()` directly to the Series.

# Q: One to Many in Practice

Consider **Orders** (left) and **OrderLines** (right):

**Orders**:

| order_id | customer_id | order_date |
|----------|------------|------------|
| 100      | C001       | 2023-01-15 |
| 101      | C002       | 2023-01-16 |
| 102      | C003       | 2023-01-17 |

**OrderLines**:

| order_id | item       | quantity |
|----------|------------|----------|
| 100      | Widget A   | 5        |
| 100      | Widget B   | 2        |
| 101      | Widget A   | 1        |
| 101      | Widget D   | 2        |
| 102      | Widget A   | 3        |
| 102      | Widget B   | 1        |
| 102      | Widget C   | 10       |

If you do:

```python
merged_orders = pd.merge(Orders, OrderLines, on="order_id", how="inner")
```

How many rows result?

## A
3 total rows

## B
7 total rows

## C
10 total rows

## Answer
B

## Correct message
Correct! There are 3 orders, but each has multiple matching order lines for a total of 7 merged rows.

## Incorrect message
Each order row is duplicated to match its lines, resulting in 7 total rows.
