title: "Multiple Choice Quiz | Other Grouped Operations: transform, value_counts and cumsum"
---

# Intro 

This quiz covers additional grouped operations in pandas, such as using transform to add group-level statistics, counting values with value_counts, and computing cumulative sums within groups. Good luck!

# Q: Summation with transform

You want to add a new column "precip_sum_month" in the weather DataFrame, which stores the sum of precipitation for each month in the original DataFrame shape. Which code accomplishes this task?

## A
```python
weather["precip_sum_month"] = weather.groupby("month")["precipitation"].agg("sum")
```

## B
```python
weather["precip_sum_month"] = weather.groupby("month")["precipitation"].transform("sum")
```

## C
```python
weather["precip_sum_month"] = weather["precipitation"].cumsum()
```

## Answer

B

## Correct message

Nice job! transform matches each row to the group-level sum, allowing you to preserve the original DataFrame shape.

## Incorrect message

Remember that transform is needed to ensure the result returns to the original DataFrame shape rather than collapsing it.

# Q: transform vs agg

What is the main difference between using "agg" and "transform" on a grouped DataFrame?

## A

agg returns a single row per group, while transform returns something of the same shape as the original data.

## B

agg returns multiple rows matching the original data, while transform only shows a single row per group.

## C

They both produce the same output.

## Answer

A

## Correct message

Correct. agg collapses groups, whereas transform preserves the original shape.

## Incorrect message

agg collapses groups by returning a single result (per group), while transform returns a result for every row in the original data.

# Q: Weather type counts

Consider the dataset below: 

| month | weather  | temperature | precipitation |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| 1     | Sunny    | 12         | 0.0           |
| 1     | Cloudy   | 10         | 0.2           |
| 1     | Sunny    | 11         | 0.0           |
| 2     | Rainy    | 8          | 1.5           |
| 2     | Rainy    | 7          | 2.0           |
| 2     | Cloudy   | 9          | 0.5           |
| 3     | Sunny    | 15         | 0.0           |
| 3     | Sunny    | 16         | 0.0           |
| 3     | Rainy    | 12         | 1.0           |

You need to count how many instances of each weather type occur in each month, to return something like this:

```
month  weather
1      Sunny     2
       Cloudy    1
2      Rainy     2
       Cloudy    1
3      Sunny     2
       Rainy     1
```
Which of the following code snippets does this?

## A
```python
weather["weather"].value_counts(normalize=True)
```

## B
```python
weather.groupby("month")["weather"].count()
```

## C
```python
weather.groupby("month")["weather"].value_counts()
```

## Answer

C

## Correct message

Exactly. groupby("month")["weather"].value_counts() will return counts per weather type, within each month.

## Incorrect message

Check how value_counts is being applied. You need to group by "month" first, then apply value_counts on the "weather" data.

# Q: Normalized value counts

How do you get proportions (like percentages) of each weather type by month instead of just counts?

## A
```python
weather.groupby("month")["weather"].value_counts(normalize=True)
```

## B
```python
weather["weather"].value_counts(percentage=True)
```

## C
```python
weather["weather"].value_counts().reset_index()
```

## Answer

A

## Correct message

Right. The normalize=True argument gives you proportions, and grouping by month ensures the calculation is within each month.

## Incorrect message

Remember to specify normalize=True on the value_counts, and to apply it after grouping.

# Q: Cumulative sum usage

Which of the following code snippets correctly calculates cumulative precipitation for each month (resetting the sum at the start of a new month)?

## A
```python
weather["precip_cumul"] = weather["precipitation"].cumsum()
```

## B
```python
weather["precip_cumul"] = weather.groupby("precipitation")["month"].cumsum()
```

## C
```python
weather["precip_cumul"] = weather.groupby("month")["precipitation"].cumsum()
```

## Answer

C

## Correct message

Yes! Grouping by month before cumsum ensures each month's cumulative sum starts fresh.

## Incorrect message

Use groupby("month") on precipitation, then apply cumsum to get monthly cumulative totals.
